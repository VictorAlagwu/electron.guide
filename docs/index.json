In the BrowserWindow event life-cycle, dom-ready always comes before ready-to-show. You can inject data like this:  const { BrowserWindow } = require(\u0026#39;electron\u0026#39;) let win = new BrowserWindow({ show: false }) win.once(\u0026#39;ready-to-show\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { win.show() }) win.webContents.on(\u0026#39;dom-ready\u0026#39;, (event) =\u0026gt; { win.webContents.send(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;channel\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, Data1, Data2, Data3) })  See:\n https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents  Prevent BrowserWindow refreshes A user can press Cmd+R (on macOS) or F5 (on Windows) to refresh the webpage shown by the BrowserWindow. True native applications don\u0026rsquo;t exhibit this behaviour.\nThe recommended solution is to replace the default menu to disable this behaviour.\nFor Kiosk Mode, another solution is to Disable the keyboard shortcuts when the BrowserWindow takes focus and then unregister the shortcuts when the BrowserWindow loses focus or is closed/hidden.\nconst { globalShortcut } = require(\u0026#39;electron\u0026#39;) win.on(\u0026#39;focus\u0026#39;, (event) =\u0026gt; { globalShortcut.registerAll([\u0026#39;CommandOrControl+R\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;F5\u0026#39;], () =\u0026gt; {}) }) win.on(\u0026#39;blur\u0026#39;, (event) =\u0026gt; { globalShortcut.unregisterAll() })  See: https://electronjs.org/docs/api/global-shortcut\nPrevent File Drags into BrowserWindow A user can drag a file into a BrowserWindow. The BrowserWindow will then display the file. You can disable it by using https://github.com/ecrmnn/electron-disable-file-drop.\nrequire(\u0026#39;electron-disable-file-drop\u0026#39;); // In renderer process  Disable Dragging and User Selections Users can drag certain elements inside the Body. They can also \u0026ldquo;select\u0026rdquo; content on the window (to cut/copy). True native applications don\u0026rsquo;t exhibit this behavior.\nAdd this CSS:\n.noselect { -webkit-touch-callout: none; /* iOS Safari */ -webkit-user-select: none; /* Safari */ -khtml-user-select: none; /* Konqueror HTML */ -moz-user-select: none; /* Firefox */ -ms-user-select: none; /* Internet Explorer/Edge */ user-select: none; /* Non-prefixed version, currently supported by Chrome and Opera */ } Add this attribute and class to the Body and various HTML elements:\n\u0026lt;body draggable=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;noselect\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Hide DevTools The user can easily open up the BrowserWindow DevTools and peek inside and modify your variables. This is very dangerous from a security perspective.\nThe user can open the DevTools by keyboard shortcuts and passing command line arguments.\nRemember to disable it for Production release:\nconst { BrowserWindow } = require(\u0026#39;electron\u0026#39;) let win = new BrowserWindow({ webPreferences: {devTools: false} })  See: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#new-browserwindowoptions\nYou may have to take other measures too to hide DevTools successfully.\n","excerpt":"The Final Polish before release The BrowserWindow is actually a chromium web browser!\nPassing data into BrowserWindow If you use React.js for your BrowserWindow javascript, you may need to pass data from the main process to the renderer process just in time for your initial state and props.\nYou need to know the difference between these two events: dom-ready and ready-to-show.\n ready-to-show event is part of BrowserWindow, and dom-ready event is part of webContents.","ref":"https://electron.guide/final-polish/renderer/","title":"The Final Polish - BrowserWindow"},{"body":" Tray Windows    Windows 10 Windows 7               Tray menu      Tray menu        Balloon      Balloon       macOS   Known Bugs  Once you create a tray icon, attempting to destroy it will crash the application.
